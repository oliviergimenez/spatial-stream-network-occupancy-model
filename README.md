**Abstract**:
To monitor streams and rivers biodiversity, we need to quantify species distribution. To do so, occupancy models allow distinguishing the non-detection of a species from its actual absence. Occupancy models can account for spatial autocorrelation, but are not suited for streams and rivers because of their spatial structure in networks. Here I propose spatial occupancy models for data collected on stream and river networks. I present the statistical developments of the model, then I illustrate the approach on a semi-aquatic mammal. Overall, spatial stream network occupancy models provide a formal approach to assess biodiversity in streams and rivers.
