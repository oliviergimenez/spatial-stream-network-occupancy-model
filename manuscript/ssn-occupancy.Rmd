To monitor streams and rivers biodiversity, we need to quantify species distribution. To do so, occupancy models allow distinguishing the non-detection of a species from its actual absence. Occupancy models can account for spatial autocorrelation, but are not suited for streams and rivers because of their spatial structure in networks. Here I propose spatial occupancy models for data collected on stream and river networks. I present the statistical developments of the model, then I illustrate the approach on a semi-aquatic mammal. Overall, spatial stream network occupancy models provide a formal approach to assess biodiversity in streams and rivers.

# Introduction

Streams and rivers provide essential habitats for numerous species of animals and plants, many of which are endemic [@D2006; @Reid2019]. The ecological health of these freshwater ecosystems is paramount not only for the biodiversity they harbor but also for the ecosystem services they provide, which are indispensable to both wildlife and human populations [@V2022]. However, human activities are altering the natural conditions of streams, rivers and their associated riparian habitats, jeopardizing the persistence of these ecosystems [@A2020].

In that context, species distribution models (SDMs) are essential tools in understanding and preserving biodiversity [@Elith2009]. SDMs predict the distribution of species, helping scientists and conservationists identify critical habitats and biodiversity hotspots. SDMs also inform strategies aimed at mitigating impacts of climate and land-use changes, manage invasive species or enhancing habitat connectivity in freshwater ecosystems [@D2015].

SDMs are known to be affected by two main issues, namely imperfect detection and spatial autocorrelation [@GK2018]. First, a species present in a given area may go undetected during surveys due to various factors such as observer experience, species behavior, and environmental conditions. Ignoring *imperfect detection* can lead to biased estimates of species distribution, and flawed inference about the relationship between species presence and environmental factors [@Kery2008; @Lahoz2014], potentially misinforming conservation strategies and habitat management decisions. To address this issue, occupancy models are SDMs that rely on repeated visits of spatial sampling units for inferring distribution [@mackenzie2017]. These models have been widely used in freshwater ecosystems for various taxa [@Charbonnel2022; @Hamer2021; @Wedderburn2022; @Preece2021]. Second, SDMs rely on the assumption of independent residuals, which may be violated if sampling sites that are close together tend to have similar probabilities of species presence. Ignoring *spatial autocorrelation* can lead to biased estimates of species distribution, and can inflate the probability of erroneously detecting the effect of environmental covariates [@Dormann2007]. Several extensions of occupancy models have been proposed to account for spatial autocorrelation, building on the spatial statistics literature, e.g. conditional autoregressive models [@Broms2014; @Johnson2013] and geoadditive models [@Rushing2019]. However, these models rely on the Euclidean distance between the spatial sampling units, which does not acknowledge the spatial structure in networks of streams and rivers.

Here I propose spatial occupancy models that allow spatial autocorrelation structured according to stream flow and flow connectivity [@Peterson2013]. I build on the linear mixed modelling approach proposed by [@VerHoef2010; @Peterson2010], which allows considering a mixture of distance-based spatial correlation structures (Euclidean or not) in a single model. I plug-in this variance component approach into occupancy models using a Bayesian approach. I present the statistical developments of the model, and I illustrate the approach on a semi-aquatic mammal in French streams and rivers. 

# Methods

## Occupancy models

To account for imperfect detection, I use occupancy models that allow inferring the actual species distribution [@mackenzie2017]. We assume the monitoring of a species occurs over $S$ spatial sampling units, or *sites*. If detection was perfect, the state $z_i$ of a site $i$ would be a Bernoulli random variable taking value 1 with *occupancy probability* $\psi_i$ if the site was occupied, and 0 otherwise with probability $1-\psi$. However, the ecological process of state occupancy $z_i$ is only partially known, because the species may go undetected whereas actually present of that site $i$. Therefore we need to consider the observation process, also a Bernoulli random variable, on top of the ecological process. When the species is detected on site $i$, say $y_i = 1$ with *detection probability* $p$, then that site is occupied, whereas if the species goes undetected with probability $1-p$, i.e. $y_i = 0$, we simply do not know whether the site is occupied or not. Both parameters, $\psi$ and $p$, can be modeled as functions of explanatory spatial variables, in the spirit of generalized linear models and logistic regressions. The only requirement to separately estimate the occupancy and detection probabilities is to collect data in at least two independent visits in time for a number of sites, and this temporal replication should be over a short period so that sites remain in the same state. 

## Spatial autocorrelation for stream networks

How is spatial autocorrelation accounted for in occupancy models? The usual way is to write the probabilities of occupancy $\boldsymbol{\psi} = (\psi_1, \ldots, \psi_S)$ on some scale, say the logit scale, as a function of explanatory variables gathered in a matrix $\mathbf{X}$ with corresponding regression parameters $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ to be estimated, and add a random effect $\boldsymbol{\epsilon}$ to capture spatial autocorrelation [@GK2018]: 

```{=tex}
\begin{equation*}
\text{logit}(\boldsymbol{\psi}) = \mathbf{X} \boldsymbol{\beta} + \boldsymbol{\epsilon}.
\end{equation*}
```

The random effect $\boldsymbol{\epsilon}$ can be structured using a conditional autoregressive models and its extensions [@Johnson2013] or geoadditive models [@Rushing2019]. Whatever the method, the proximity among sites is assessed using the Euclidean distance, which fails to adequately capture complex spatial dependencies in streams and rivers. Specifically, we are interested in flow connectivity and stream and river topology [@Peterson2013]. Following [@VerHoef2010; @Peterson2010], I consider two sites as being *flow-connected* when water flows from an upstream site to a downstream site, and *flow-unconnected* when they share a common confluence downstream but do not share flow. Then I parameterize occupancy by rewriting the random effect as a mixture of four components as follows: 

```{=tex}
\begin{equation*}
\text{logit}(\boldsymbol{\psi}) = \mathbf{X} \boldsymbol{\beta} + \boldsymbol{\tau}_{tu} + \boldsymbol{\tau}_{td} + \boldsymbol{\tau}_{eu} + \boldsymbol{\epsilon}
\end{equation*}
```

where $\boldsymbol{\tau}_{tu}$ is a random effect with spatial covariance between flow-connected sites that can occur in the same direction of the river flow (*tail-up*, think of organisms that move passively like, e.g., mussels), $\boldsymbol{\tau}_{td}$ is a random effect with spatial covariance between flow-connected and flow-unconnected sites that can occur with or against the direction of the flow (*tail-down*, think of organisms that move actively like, e.g., semi-aquatic mammals), $\boldsymbol{\tau}_{eu}$ is a random effect with a spatial covariance independent of the network topology (generated by, e.g., air temperature or precipitation), and $\boldsymbol{\epsilon}$ is a random effect which variance, often called the nugget, can absorb extra-variability. Writing these covariance components is described in details elsewhere: Appendix B in [@Peterson2010], [@isaak2014applications]. I provide an example below. 

## Implementation

For all analyses, I used the statistical language `R` `r citep(citation())`. I fitted models in the Bayesian framework by specifying weakly informative priors [@Northrup2018], implementing a marginalized likelihood [@clark2019] and using the `rstan` `r citep(citation("rstan"))` package. I also used the `openSTARS` [@Kattwinkel2020] and `SSN` [@VerHoef2014] packages to build and characterize the network and calculate hydrological distances.  

## Case study

[@Couturier2024]

[@Kervellec2023]

Sites in counties Lot (46), Aveyron (12) and Cantal (15). First two are in Pyrénées, third is in Massif Central. 

The species went almost extinct in the 20th century, it was hunted for its fur. Thanks to the banning of hunting and its protection, it is now recolonizing our country. In that context, the question we’re asking is what is its current distribution. 

To answer this question, we collect scats the species leaves behind. 

Now to the case study. I investigated the effect of human disturbance on otter occupancy. 
The study site is in this rectangle here, between Montpellier where I live and Swansea. 
There were 56 sites that were visited 3 times. 
Clearly we have some spatial variation in the number of detections. 
I used human density as a proxy for human disturbance. 
Human density can lead to disturbance of otters through urbanization for example. 
We recorded human density as the number of inhabitants per km2 in a buffer around each stream. 

I use tail-down only. Exponential structure, with decreasing correlation with increasing distance. Ecrire le modèle ici avec l'exponentielle:

\[
    \text{Cov}(\epsilon_i,\epsilon_j)= 
\begin{cases}
    \displaystyle{\sigma^2\exp(-d_{ij}/\theta)},& \text{if sites } i \text{ and } j \text{ are connected }\\
    0,              & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\]

Expliquer les paramètres d, s et theta. 

# Results

See Fig. \@ref(fig:mainfig).

When spatial autocorrelation is ignored, we found a negative effect of human density on occupancy probability.

However, when we accounted for spatial autocorrelation using our new model, human density had no longer an effect on occupancy. 

The effect size of human density increases when spatial autocorrelation is ignored. 

The most likely explanation is that of a bias due to an omitted variable. 
Human density is spatially correlated, and its effect size is inflated. 
This bias is controlled when spatial autocorrelation is included.
There is probably a difference in occupancy according to another variable that would need to be accounted for.

# Discussion

Si besoin, merge results and discussion sections. 

The focal ecological parameter of interest is the occupancy probability  $\psi$, which is represented similarly in all the five models compared. However, the precision of the occupancy estimation is impacted by the quality of the estimation for the detection process (kery2008, kellner2014). In this study, we focused on cases in which data is collected continuously, for example with sensors or opportunistic data. We aimed to evaluate whether modelling the detection process in continuous time could enhance the precision of the estimated probability of occupancy.

Ecologically, omitted bias variable. Check in Couturier which one it could be. Citer quand même le papier de Hodges sur spatial confusion. Citer aussi les échanges avec Jay VerHoef pour la difficulté in estimating le sill parameter. Mais ok pour covariate et prediction de l'occupancy. 

Application à eDNA. Alors besoin peut-être d'autres termes spatiaux comme tail-up, et euclidean. Ici on a utilisé que tail-down car on s'interesse aux otters. eDNA important pour monitor biodiv in freshwater and marine realms. If false positives wored out (voir work de E. Matechou), resste à proprement prendfre en compte spatial autocorrelation. 

Extension à dynamic occupancy models. Colonization function of distance to features that hamper movement of individuals. Citer les papier de Chandler, Morin et celui à paraître de Kervellec. L'idée est qu'on pourrait regarder la question de la connectivité dans river et stream network. Pas super compliqué, le papier du portuguais a paved the road.

Extending to dynamic occupancy to write the probability of colonization as a function of distance to landscape features that might hamper movements, and therefore assessing connectivity.

From paper by Johnson. By exploiting autocorrelation when present, one can potentially decrease the number of visits to specific survey units
within a study area, instead relying on spatial dependence to take the place of some temporal replication.
ALSO. The issue of spatial confounding is relatively new in
the statistics literature. As Hodges and Reich (2010)
state, it is a ‘‘rich area of research.’’ Experienced spatial
modelers might say that confounding is desirable as it
allows an adjustment in fixed effects inference due to
unmeasured (unknown), spatially correlated covariates.
However, Hodges, Hodges and Reich (2010) and
Paciorek (2010) illustrate bias and variance inflation
depend on the structure of these unmeasured variables.
Because the structure of these latent spatial variables is
unknown, a spatial model may not account for them the
way the researcher intends. Hodges and Reich (2010)
note that without knowledge of the missing structure,
purposefully adding spatial confounding is a haphazard
adjustment that may bias the known fixed effects in
unknown ways. There may be some middle ground,
however, that is worth exploring (Paciorek 2010) and
could be the topic of future research in the context of
occupancy modeling and spatial modeling in general.

From Rushing paper. The distributions of most species are characterized by complex and dynamic variation in occurrence. Species distribution modeling seeks to relate this variation to environmental covariates and extrapolate these relationships to unsampled sites and times. Because habitats and species-habitat relationships change across both space and time, conventional GLM-based models rarely capture the inherent complexity of species distributions, especially when inferences are made across large spatial or long temporal scales. Here, we demonstrate a novel occupancy-based SDM that combines environmental predictors with a spatial GAM to model covariate relationships and complex, non-linear spatial variation in occupancy probability while accounting for imperfect detection.
